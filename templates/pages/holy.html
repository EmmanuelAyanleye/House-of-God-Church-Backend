              The Holy Police Department was established in 1988. It is responsible for ensuring the security of cars parked in the churchâ€™s car park while members attend worship services. The department also manages traffic during church activities and warmly welcomes members at the parking area, ensuring a smooth flow of vehicles.
              <br><br>
              Beyond this, the department is tasked with maintaining the safety of the entire church premises. They ensure a secure environment for worshippers, providing a sense of safety and peace during services. Their duties also include protecting church property from vandalism or unauthorized access, maintaining the sanctity of the holy grounds.
              <br><br>
              The department is composed of approximately 20 committed members who volunteer their time and efforts. 
              <br><br>
              They convene on the last Saturday of each month to discuss security strategies, review their responsibilities, and plan for upcoming church events.

              The Protocol Department of the Household of God Church was established in 2011. They are primarily responsible for handling all logistics and travel arrangements for the pastor and other members of the ministry, ensuring seamless coordination both locally and globally. Their duties also include maintaining order and ensuring smooth coordination during church services and other church programs, creating an environment of respect and discipline.
              <br><br>
              The department is responsible for security checks, including frisking attendees during church services, to ensure the safety of all worshippers. They also maintain order within the church auditorium, managing seating arrangements and assisting members to their seats, especially during special events.
              <br><br>
              The Protocol Department is composed of approximately 40 dedicated members, who work together to fulfill these responsibilities. They meet every last Saturday of the month for planning, training, and reviewing their duties, ensuring they remain efficient in their service.

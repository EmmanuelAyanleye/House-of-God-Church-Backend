              Works Department came into existence in 1999. The department handles the cleaning of the church premises, the household of God street, the Citadel surroundings, the car park and the drainages. Our strength comes from the word of God in Ecclesiastes Chapter 9 verse 10a which says “ Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might”.
              <br><br>
              We believe, as born again Christians who have been cleansed/washed by the precious blood of the lamb, to keep our Father’s house clean and neat at all times and to trust Him, that faithfulness which is required to stewards be found in us.
              <br><br>
              The department is all about working\rendering services to the glory of God our Father. We are blessed, totally and completely and by serving in a department, we become co-laborers with our Pastor in the work of God. And we are so humbled that God found us worthy putting us in the ministry.
              Approximately, we have sixty (60) members and our meeting day is every Saturday of the week by 12noon, where we hold a brief meeting for thirty (30) minutes after which we disperse to start cleaning.
